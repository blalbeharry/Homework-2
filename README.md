# Portfolio

Linked to deployed portfolio page: https://blalbeharry.github.io/Portfolio/

In this assignment, I created a template index, portfolio, and contact page using both HTML and CSS. The formatting was achieved by importing bootstrap and manipulating it as desired. I have created some filler content and not fully functional links that will be filled in when there changes. There are also some links that are not properly directed to the completed product. 
It was a ton of fun to utilize these different languages to help create something and I hope that you all like my work in progress!
